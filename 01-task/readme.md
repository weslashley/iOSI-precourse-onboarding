## Accounts

First, you'll need to set up a few accounts, if you haven't already.

* [ ] **Required**: [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join), if you don't already have one.
* [ ] **Required**: Register for an [Apple ID, if you don't already have one.](https://www.apple.com/support/appleid/create-signin/)
* [ ] *Optional*: Use your Apple ID to [sign up for a paid Apple Developer account.](https://developer.apple.com)

Note: *Students will need to sign up for a paid Apple Developer account in order to submit apps to the app store. We'll discuss this further in-class!*

<a name="install"></a>
## Technology

Next, let's review the technology required and do some light installations. For more information, check out our policy below.

* [ ] **Required**: Make sure you have a Mac laptop, with an updated OS (currently 10.11 "El Capitan").
* [ ] **Required**: Install the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
* [ ] **Required**: [Configure Xcode for your Command Line](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html).
* [ ] **Required**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* [ ] **Required**: [Configure Git for your command line](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).
* [ ] **Required**: [Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads)! Slack is the primary messaging platform we'll use in this course.
* [ ] **Required**: Join our `GA-Students` group, where you'll be able to share resources and tips with fellow students in our `iosi-precourse` channel.
* [ ] *Optional*: We highly recommend installing a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com).
* [ ] *Optional*: If you have a secondary iOS device (e.g. iPhone or iPad), bring it to class so you can use it to test your apps!

#### Technology Policy

Due to the necessary tools used for iOS development, **Macs are required** for this course. We strongly suggest that students bring laptops with screens of *at least 13-inches*. Having an 11-inch (or smaller) screen has been shown to adversely affect student performance.

Student laptops should be using OS X 10.10 or higher, ideally 10.11 (El Capitan). *This rules out some older MacBook models.* If you have any questions, feel free to connect with your instructor!
