# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Welcome to iOS Development Immersive!

Welcome to the iOS Development Immersive at General Assembly! We're really excited that you're joining our General Assembly community. In order to ensure your success in the course, we’ve created a series of pre-course on-boarding tasks. Depending on your level of prior knowledge, these modules may take you between 40-60 hours to complete.

Please complete **all** items **before** your first day of class, so that both you and your computer will be prepared to hit the ground running. If you have questions in the meantime (or just want to say hi!), feel free to reach out to your instructional team!

Sincerely,

GA + your iOS Immersive Team

## Accounts

First, you'll need to set up a few accounts, if you haven't already.

1. [ ] **Required**: [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join), if you don't already have one.
2. [ ] **Required**: Register for an [Apple ID, if you don't already have one.](https://www.apple.com/support/appleid/create-signin/)
3. [ ] **Required**: Use your Apple ID to [sign up for a paid Apple Developer account.](https://developer.apple.com)

## Technology

Next, let's review the technology required and do some light installations. For more information, check out our policy below.

1. [ ] **Required**: Make sure you have a Mac laptop, with an updated OS.
2. [ ] **Required**: Install the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
3. [ ] *Optional*: Install a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com).
4. [ ] *Optional*: If you have a secondary iOS device (e.g. iphone or ipad), bring it to class so you can use it to test your apps!

#### Technology Policy

Due to the necessary tools used for iOS development, **Macs are required** for this course. We strongly suggest that students bring laptops with screens of *at least 13-inches*. Having an 11-inch (or smaller) screen has been shown to adversely affect student performance.

Student laptops should be using OS X 10.8.5 or higher, ideally 10.11.4 (El Capitan). *This rules out some older MacBook models.* If you have any questions, feel free to connect with your instructor!
